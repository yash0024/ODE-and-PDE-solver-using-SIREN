# ODE-and-PDE-solver-using-SIREN
An ODE and PDE solver created via neural networks with sinusoidal activations. Demonstrated better performance than other activations such as ReLU and tanh. Supports vectorised ODE's/PDE's as well as higher order ODE's/PDE's. Please refer to the pdf to learn more about the steps taken to solve the ODE/PDE at hand, and about the architecture used. Created in collaboration with [Hans Shi](https://github.com/hanss314).
